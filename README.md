# Starter Kit

A OpenZeppelin kit containing React, OpenZeppelin SDK, Truffle and Infura.

This kit comes with everything you need to start using upgradeable Smart
contracts inside your applications. It also includes all the configuration
required to deploy to different networks.

## Requirements

Install OpenZeppelin SDK, Ganache, and Truffle

```
npm install -g truffle@5.0.2 ganache-cli@6.3.0 @openzeppelin/cli@2.5.1
```

## Installation

First ensure you are in a new and empty directory.

Run the `unpack` command.

```javascript
openzeppelin unpack zepkit
```

## Run

Run your local blockchain unlocking your first account:

```
ganache-cli --deterministic
```

Initialize the OpenZeppelin SDK project

```javascript
openzeppelin init app
```

In the `client` directory, we run the React app.

```javascript
// in another terminal (i.e. not in the truffle develop prompt)
cd client
npm run start
```

## Test

Truffle can run tests written in Solidity or JavaScript against your smart contracts. Note the command varies slightly if you're in or outside of the development console.

```javascript
// inside the development console.
test

// outside the development console..
truffle test
```

Jest is included for testing React components. Compile your contracts before running Jest, or you may receive some file not found errors.

```javascript
// ensure you are inside the client directory when running this
npm run test
```

## Build

To build the application for production, use the build script. A production build will be in the `client/build` folder.

```javascript
// ensure you are inside the client directory when running this
npm run build
```

## FAQ

- **How do I use this with the Ganache-CLI?**

  It's as easy as modifying the config file! [Check out our documentation on adding network configurations](http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/configuration#networks). Depending on the port you're using, you'll also need to update line 29 of `client/src/utils/getWeb3.js`.

- **Where is my production build?**

  The production build will be in the `client/build` folder after running `npm run build` in the `client` folder.

- **Where can I find more documentation?**

  This box is a marriage of [ZeppelinOS](https://zeppelinos.org//) and a React setup created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md). Either one would be a great place to start!

## Quick Command Reference

- Add a contract: `openzeppelin add <contract_name>`
- Create upgradeable instance of a contract: `openzeppelin create <contract_name>`
- Update an upgradeable contract: `openzeppelin update <contract_name>`
- Test contracts: `truffle test`
- Test dapp: `cd client && npm test`
- Run dev server: `cd client && npm run start`
- Build for production: `cd client && npm run build`
