= Quick Start

OpenZeppelin Starter Kit comes with everything you need to start using upgradeable Smart
contracts inside your applications. It also includes all the configuration
required to deploy to different networks.

## Requirements

Install OpenZeppelin SDK, Ganache, and Truffle.

``
npm install -g truffle@5.0.2 ganache-cli@6.3.0 @openzeppelin/cli@2.5.1
``

## Installation

Ensure you are in a new and empty directory, and run the `unpack` command with the name of the
starter kit you want to use. In this case we'll start our project using the kit with the name `starter`.

``
openzeppelin unpack starter
``

TIP: You can use other starter kits as well. You can find them all xref:list.adoc[here].

## Run

In a new terminal window, run your local blockchain:

``
ganache-cli --deterministic
``

In your original terminal window, at the top level of your folder, initialize the project
and follow the prompts:


``
openzeppelin init
``


In a new terminal window, in the `client` directory, run the React app:

``
cd client
npm run start
``

## Interact

You can interact directly with your smart contracts from the `openzeppelin` cli.

Commands start with either `openzeppelin` or with the `oz` shorthand.
[horizontal]
``openzeppelin transfer``:: To send funds to a given address.

``openzeppelin balance [address]``::  To query the ETH balance of the specified account, also supports ERC20s.

``openzeppelin send-tx``::  To send a transaction to your contract and returns the events.

``openzeppelin call``::  To execute a constant method and receive back the value.

`openzeppelin`:: To see a complete list of available commands.


## Test

Truffle can run tests written in Solidity or JavaScript against your smart contracts. Note the command varies slightly if you're in or outside of the truffle development console.

From inside the development console.

``
test
``

From outside the development console.

``
truffle test
``

Jest is included for testing React components. Compile your contracts before running Jest, or you may receive some file not found errors.

From inside the client directory when running this
``
npm run test
``

## Build

To build the application for production, use the build script. A production build will be in the `client/build` folder.

``
// ensure you are inside the client directory when running this
npm run build
``
